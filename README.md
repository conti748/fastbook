#  Fastbook Insights: Notes, Exercises, and Advanced Experiments for Fastai's Book

Taking notes, deepening assignment and experimenting with the material from [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook), the book offered by [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) and the relative [course](https://course.fast.ai/).

## Why this repository?
In my journey, I consider myself a good guy  with a robust theoretical background thanks to my engineering studies: an apparently perfect launchpad for deep learning. By chance, I came across a book on ["Meta-Learning"](https://radekosmulski.gumroad.com/l/learn_deep_learning), thinking it would unveil the secrets of implementing ML systems  able to learn autonomously  from different tasks and adapting their behavior accordingly. 

As it turns out, the book had a different agenda: it was about the how people can improve in their skills in learning with a focus on deep learning. Intrigued, I started reading it, realizing that something was amiss with my approach. Sure, I had delved into Machine Learning, deep learning, and dissected Auto-Regressive models from a theoretical perspective at the university. Further, I had 3 years of experience at work and also some practice with personal projects. Nevertheless, I felt that I could inject more life into my understanding by putting myself in someone else's shoes.

Radek Osmulski, the author of "Meta Learning: How To Learn Deep Learning And Thrive In The Digital World," couldn't code at 29 and lacks a college degree. Now he is now a Senior Data Scientist at Nvidia. From his book, I gathered the most important ideas that piqued my interest: 
- the right balance between theory and practice;  - the importance of developer skills and how to improve it (i.e. coding);
- the significance of taking notes;
- the importance of sharing experience.

Hence, I aimed to leverage all the concepts in his book to challenge myself and start learning differently and more practically. Osmulski, in his book, suggests "fastbook" by fast.ai as one of the best starting points to learn.

Upon reading the book information, I was amazed by its approach, even though it began with the basics. While I already knew much of it, there was undeniable value in tracing the author's journey. The author of the book and the corresponding course is Jeremy Howard, the former President and Chief Scientist of Kaggle. I admired his lectures, notebooks, and, most of all, his approach to deep learning and coding.

Finally, I decided to embark on this new journey and take notes as a diligent developer. Engaging deeply with the book's content, I dedicated time to hands-on practice, constructing a tangible portfolio featuring various projects. My aspiration is that this repository could be valuable to other professionals venturing into the realm of deep learning.
